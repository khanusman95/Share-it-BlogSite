Note:

1-This website was developed using MAMP server therefore, the username and password for database connection needs to be 
changed according to your phpmyadmin credentials.

2- Port number for phpmyadmin is also set to default settings in MAMP server i.e "8889". If the website is opened using
anyother server then, the port number needs to be changed in the code.
